<p>Type: Python code</p>



<p>Contents: A Python code to compute determinants from the sum of
arborescence weights and from LU decomposition.  The routine can also
print out pdf figures of the arborescences.  The code is maintained at this
<a href="https://github.com/Sayani26/siam_review_2023">GitHub website</a>.
That site also gives instructions for the code's use.
